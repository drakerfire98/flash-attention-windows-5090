# flash-attention-windows-5090

Working Windows build notes, patches, and smoke tests for building FlashAttention on an NVIDIA RTX 5090 with PyTorch nightly and CUDA 13.0.

## Status

- FlashAttention 2 source build verified on the recorded Windows x64 host in `docs/KNOWN_GOOD_ENV.md`
- Verified on Python 3.13.9
- Verified on `torch 2.12.0.dev20260306+cu130`
- Verified on CUDA toolkit 13.0
- Verified on `NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090`
- Verified built package result: `flash_attn 2.8.4`
- Exact environment fingerprint recorded in `docs/KNOWN_GOOD_ENV.md`

This repo preserves the exact working path that compiled and ran a CUDA smoke test on the target machine. The main blocker we had to fix was PyTorch's Windows ninja generation quoting `nvcc` with POSIX-style single quotes, which breaks `CreateProcess` on Windows.

## What Is Here

- `docs/KNOWN_GOOD_ENV.md`: exact versions that worked
- `docs/REBUILD_STEPS.md`: repeatable rebuild instructions
- `scripts/build_flashattn_windows.cmd`: wrapper to compile from source
- `scripts/collect_env.py`: emits a JSON fingerprint of the local machine, Python env, and toolchain
- `scripts/patch_torch_cpp_extension_windows.py`: patches the local torch env to emit a Windows-safe `nvcc` launcher
- `scripts/patch_flash_attn_setup.py`: patches `setup.py` in the source tree for explicit `BUILD_TARGET` handling
- `scripts/smoke_test_flash_attn.py`: import and CUDA execution smoke test
- `patches/*.patch`: reference diffs for the two required source edits

## What This Does Not Do

- It does not automatically speed up Ollama or Modelfile-based inference by itself.
- It does not claim FlashAttention 4 is working on this exact stack yet.
- It does not bundle the upstream FlashAttention source tree.

## FA4 Status

FlashAttention 4 was tested in a dedicated `.venv_fa4` environment on the same machine.

Current status:

- `flash-attn-4` can be installed as an editable package from the local `flash_attn/cute` tree
- the import path `from flash_attn.cute import flash_attn_func` still fails on Windows here
- exact failure: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cutlass'`

The root cause is that `nvidia-cutlass-dsl==4.4.2` installs only metadata in this environment and still requires `nvidia-cutlass-dsl-libs-base`, which does not currently resolve to a usable Windows package here.

See `docs/FA4_WINDOWS_STATUS.md` for the exact attempted install path and blocker.

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repo.
2. Clone `https://github.com/sdbds/flash-attention-for-windows` into `third_party/flash-attention-for-windows`.
3. Run `python scripts/collect_env.py --json-out local_env.json` if you want a one-shot machine fingerprint before touching the build.
4. Follow `docs/REBUILD_STEPS.md`.
5. Compare your local machine against `docs/KNOWN_GOOD_ENV.md` before debugging build failures.
